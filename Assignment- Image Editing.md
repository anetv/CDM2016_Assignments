# Image Editing Assignment
This is your major assignment for the Image section of this course. It will count for 10% of your final grade. You will create/edit three images according to the directions below and upload them to your Pitt Box folder along with a Designer's Statement.

#### Assignment details
* Three images you've edited or created in Photoshop, GIMP or similar image-processing software. One image must be created from scratch in the program, one must be using a photograph as a source image, and the third can be your choice. Your images should have your last name and be numbered and titled in the filename. Example: Vee_Image1_AdvertisementForPitt.psd
* Designer's Statement of 500-750 words that describes your composing process, triumphs, frustrations, things you learned, what you meant to get across in your three images. Included in this Statement should be your List of Sources (which doesn't count toward your word count total).
* You must make sure that you have permission to use and modify all source materials you use, and provide proper credit in your associated Designer's Statement List of Sources. You can search for Creative Commons - licensed work that you can use, use your own photos or materials from friends with their permission, etc. But you must credit *every* source image you use. 
* Rough drafts of images due for workshopping in class 10/25. (I don't have a deadline for an optional draft due to me for feedback this time, but feel free to ask me for feedback and in office hours.)
* Final versions of images and Designer's Statement to be graded due 11/1 (11:59pm), uploaded to Pitt Box as a .psd file.


#### Content
For this assignment, I'm asking you to design three images according to these constraints:  

* One must be made from scratch in your image editing program (with nothing but very minor insertions from outside images or sources), one must include a source photograph, and the third is totally open. 
* One image should be funny and one image should be thought-provoking; the third is open. 
* One image should be in the style of one of the historical design styles you read about in Lupton and Miller's _Graphic Design in America_. The other two images can be in any other style you choose. 

Obviously, there will be overlap in the image requirements. So you might have a thought-provoking photograph that is in the Art Deco style, or a funny made-from-scratch image in your choice of style or a funny made-from-scratch image in the style of chromolithography. Your images can include text if you'd like, but they don't have to. 

This assignment also includes a 500-750 word Designer's Statement, in which you will describe your composing process, triumphs, frustrations, things you learned, what you meant to get across in your three images. At the very beginning of your Statement, include your image number and titles and which criteria each image fills. Included at the end of the Statement should be your List of Sources (which doesn't count toward your word count total).

Your List of Sources must include links or attribution to every image that you've borrowed from someone else, along with a title or brief phrase so I can identify it in your image, and a note about your permission to use it. List your sources under a heading for each image.

#### Assessment

I will assess your images based on these criteria:
* Do you follow all the constraints I've listed above?
* Have you included your Designer's Statement and explained your choices well?
* Have you properly cited all of your sources and are you using sources you have permission to use? 
* Are your images actually funny or thought-provoking? 
* Have you put thought and effort into the composition of your images? 
* Are they aesthetically interesting and coherent?

#### Where and how to turn in your work
You should compose your images in image editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP. What program you use is up to you. 

You should turn in your images as three separate .psd files in your Pitt Box folder that you have shared with me. Also upload your Designer's Statement in pdf/doc/docx/md format. Turning your images in to me as .psd files will allow me to see your work better than a jpg or lossy file.

#### A few tips on writing this assignment
There are a lot of constraints on your images, but these constraints are designed to help you be creative and think of some interesting things to design and present. You could do an advertisement, logo, funny photo-meld, political-themed image, whatever you want in terms of content. Think of our class as your audience.

I don't expect you to be an expert designer! But I do expect you to put some thought and effort into this assignment. Don't forget that there are thousands of Photoshop tutorials available on the Web. 

#### Goals of this assignment
I hope that this assignment will help you:

* Gain a basic comfort level with image-editing, or allow you to stretch your skills a bit if you already know something about image-editing.
* Consider different graphic design styles
* Think about visual composition as a way to get across ideas.

Good luck and come see me in class or office hours for feedback or questions on your work.
